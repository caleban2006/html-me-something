					<h3>Crutches, i.e. - The Backstory</h3>

						<p>As you might have guessed, these events invlove some questionable decisions from teenage boys, but a back story is always needed.  For these particular boys, they cannot go to one summer camp without being hurt and coming back on crutches.  Given this fact, both sets of parents give their child a very specific rule to follow: <b>"Don't be stupid!"</b>  We would remind them of this rule every time they went camping.  So much so that both boys' goal was not to end up in the aid station.</p>
						<p>This particular camp turned out to be no different.  I know, you're shocked!</p>

					<h3>VolleyBall</h3>
						<p>It took my son only 1 day to end up in the Aid Station.  Not quite what you would have expected though as he took a volleyball to the groin.  The other boy, let's just call him Charles, was the one that took my son to the Aid Station to get some ice on his "wounded pride."  I will say that at least this Aid Station trip wasn't his fault...for a change.

					<h3>Karma...When Will She Strike</h3>

						</figure>
						<p>Now, as you could imagine, both boys whose goal was not to end up in the Aid Station, have in fact ended up in the Aid Station after only 1 day.  This time, Charles made it a point to say that at least it wasn't him for a change.  Seeing the chance for karma, my son pointed out that it was still early in the week and there is still time.  Charles then stated that he was taking extra care not to get hurt.  That's when my son sat up from the table, stared at Charles, and said, "Yeah right!"</p>

					<h2 id="sideStoryFont">Side story time!</h2>
						<p style="font-family: Comic Sans MS">If you know anything about summer camp, you know that boys will be boys.  So much in fact, that eating what you and I consider to be normal food is kind of taboo.  If they could survive on candy and soda alone, they would.  Most summer camps offer a trading post where you can buy souveigners and junk food.  Camp Powhatan was no different and even had a food counter ice cream bar for those attending summer camp that opened immediately following breakfast and closed around 9pm.  As long as you had the money, you could get anything they had.  The items that they were selling wasn't expensive, so the little money most kids brough went quite a ways.</p>
					<h2 id="sideStoryFont">Side story over!</h2>

					<h3>Gummy Bears</h3>
						<p>On day 2, myself and a couple other adults notice that Charles spent quite amount of time in the trading post buying junk food, and more specifically gummy bears!  But, no, not a normal amount of gummy bears.  Charles decided that today would be a great day to not eat normal food, but instead, eat 5 pounds of gummy bears!!!  If you are curious how many gummy bears that is, check out the image below.</p>
						<figure>
							<img src="C:/Users/68vette/Desktop/LC101/html-me-something/images/gummy_bears.jpg" width="960" alt="That's a lot of gummy bears!"> 		
						</figure>
						<p>Well, as you could imagine, after eating nothing buy gummy bears for an entire day would cause some issues.  It was probably around 2 in the morning that my son came running up to me to tell me that Charles was sick and throwing up black stuff.  Thinking the worst, I rushed to him to find out that he is just regurgiating the massive amount of gummy bears he ate that day and that is was not in fact black.  They were just looking at it in the dark, where everything appears black.  I made sure he was ok and directed him to eat normal food from here on out.</p>

				<section>
					<h3>Slurpies and Nachos</h3>
						<p>Now, at this point you would think that Charles has learned his lesson.  In fact, the next morning, I noticed that he was eating a normal breakfast.  So I though all was right again and he'll be just fine.  That is until I went to the adult lounge after breakfast and saw Charles exit the trading post with a HUGE slurpie and nachos.</p>
						<figure>
							<img src="C:/Users/68vette/Desktop/LC101/html-me-something/images/facepalm.jpg" width="960" alt="Facepalm meme"> 		
						</figure>
						<p>Charles didn't even realize that this was probably a bad idea at first.  But, once he took a bite of nachos and rinsed it down with his slurpie he immediatly regretted his decision.  He told me that he doesn't feel good, to which I responded, "Probably not considering you just tried to drink the liquified version of a gummy bear!"  That is when he put his head down, pulled out his water, and walked off.</p>

					<h3>Karma Strikes</h3>
						<p>If you think that is karma on Charles, you haven't seen nothing yet.  That very night while walking to our campsite, Charles tripped on some steps.  But not a normal trip, he tripped going up the steps and twisted his ankle.  I asked if he wanted to go the the Aid Station, but he was dead set on not going.  So I thought, oh well, it's not that bad.  Until later that night when Charles jumped from the top bunk and broke hiw ankle.</p>

						<p>He still didn't want to go to the Aid Station, so we brought the Aid Station attendant to him.</p>

						</figure>
						<p>To not make a long story longer, Charles ended up with, surprise surprise, crutches for the remainer of camp.</p>  
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>We have returned home</h3>
						<p>Now, you would think that Charles' parents would have been shocked to see him on crutches as he walked from my car to theirs, but nope.  They just looked down and shook their heads.</p>

						</p>And that my friends is how this story ends.  Two boys that do their best to avoid getting injuried, just can't help it and don't surprise their parents.</p>
